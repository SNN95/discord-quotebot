Using
------
Make sure you have "Developer Mode" enabled in Discord's Appearance settings. Right click the message you want to quote, and click "Copy ID."

Next, type {quote: where you want the quote to appear, and paste in the ID.

When you send the message, it will be replaced with the quote! Wow!

Features
------
* Easy, fast quoting
* No annoying error messages when you mess up. Nothing happens.

Limitations
-----
* Sort of spammy (bigger guilds might not like you using this)
* Only looks for quotes in the last 50 messages (if the selfbot can't find the message, nothing happens)
